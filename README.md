# cyberelia guide

## About
> Cyberelia is a cyberpunk RPG written in Typescript and is experienced through Discord. It is currently in development by [myself](https://github.com/gnp-x) as the programmer and a friend as the story/mechanics designer. Players are welcome to try it out and offer feedback. You can check it out here: https://discord.gg/xgfyfZESkv
> 
> The docs are concurrently written as we develop the game, so all the information you see is what's available to play.

## Docs Framework
This guide uses the [starlight ](https://github.com/withastro/starlight) documentation framework. If you wish to contribute, I recommend you read the [documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/pages/) first so you understand the structure.
