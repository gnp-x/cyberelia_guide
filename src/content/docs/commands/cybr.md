`/cybr` is the command available to all users and is how the player experiences the story of cyberelia.

-   For those not registered, it starts them at story_zero where they have to register a name and fight their very first enemy. Upon completion of story_zero, more of cyberelia becomes unlocked to them.
-   For those already registered, they will run this command to experience the story and unlock other abilities over time to help them progress through the story and grow as a player.

:::note
For new players, the command must be ran in `#register`. For everyone else, the command is ran in `#commands`.
