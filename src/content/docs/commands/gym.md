`/gym` is a command available to those with the [/user/](/reference/roles/#user) role and is executed in the `#commands` channel.

## usage

The gym allows you to re-allocate your [attribute](/reference/attributes/) points every 12 hours or as desired beyond the cooldown.
:::tip
Run the command [/stats](/commands/stats/) to see how many points you can allocate if you don't know.
:::

#### [required] attributes

-   targeting
-   reflex
-   analysis
-   efficiency

:::caution
You cannot use less or more than the points alloted to you. You must _allocate_ them all. Since you can re-allocate every 12 hours, there's no reason to hoard unallocated points (you can't anyway<span>
