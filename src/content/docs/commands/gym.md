`/gym` is a command available to those with the [/user/](/reference/roles/#user) role and is executed in the `#commands` channel.

## usage

The gym allows you to re-allocate your [attribute](/reference/attributes/) points.
:::tip
Run the command [/stats](/commands/stats/) to see how many points you can allocate if you don't know.
:::

#### [required] attributes

-   targeting
-   reflex
-   analysis

:::caution
You cannot use less than the points alloted to you. You must allocate them _all_. Since you can re-allocate once an hour, there's no reason to hoard unallocated points (you can't anyway<span>
